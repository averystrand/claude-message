# Product Announcement

Detail new features and capabilities with focus on customer value rather than product specifications.

## Structure

| Section | Purpose | Guidance |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Why Now | Market context or customer need | Connect the feature to a problem worth solving |
| What's New | Clear capability description | Lead with outcome, not implementation |
| How It Works | User perspective, not architecture | Focus on the experience, not the engineering |
| Who Benefits | Use cases and personas | Be specific about who this helps and why |
| Getting Started | Next steps or availability | Clear path to action |

## Tone & Style

- **Voice:** Informative, outcome-focused, not promotional
- **Length:** 800-1,200 words
- **Altitude:** Accessible to all stakeholders; technical details for those who want them

Resist the urge to oversell. Announce what it does, explain why it matters, show how to use it. Trust the reader to recognize value.

## SEO/GEO Optimization

- Feature names as H2/H3 headers for discoverability
- Use case scenarios that match search intent
- Comparison to alternatives (without disparagement)
- Clear availability and access information

## Example

**Input:** Write a product announcement for a new vulnerability prioritization feature

**Output:**

# Introducing Risk-Based Vulnerability Prioritization

Vulnerability scanners find thousands of issues. Knowing which ones matter is a different problem entirely.

## Why Now

Security teams face an impossible math problem: more vulnerabilities than hours to fix them. Traditional severity scores (CVSS) don't account for your environment—whether an asset is internet-facing, what data it holds, or whether compensating controls exist. The result? Teams either fix the wrong things first or drown trying to fix everything.

## What's New

Risk-Based Vulnerability Prioritization combines vulnerability data with asset context to surface the issues that actually threaten your organization. Instead of 10,000 "critical" findings, you get a ranked list that reflects your specific risk.

## How It Works

The system evaluates each vulnerability against:
- **Asset criticality:** Is this a crown jewel or a test box?
- **Exposure:** Internet-facing or isolated network segment?
- **Exploitability:** Active exploitation in the wild?
- **Compensating controls:** Is there mitigation already in place?

The result is a prioritized queue that updates as your environment changes.

## Who Benefits

- **Security Operations:** Focus remediation on what matters
- **Vulnerability Management:** Report meaningful risk reduction
- **IT Operations:** Receive actionable, prioritized tickets

## Getting Started

Risk-Based Vulnerability Prioritization is available today for all Enterprise customers. Access it from the Vulnerabilities dashboard or contact your account team for a walkthrough.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion | Target | Red Flags |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Value Clarity | Reader understands benefit within first 100 words | Feature-first instead of value-first |
| Outcome Focus | Emphasizes what users achieve, not specs | Technical architecture without user benefit |
| Credibility | Claims are specific and believable | Hyperbolic marketing language |
| Accessibility | All stakeholders can understand the value | Jargon-heavy, assumes product familiarity |
| Clear CTA | Reader knows exactly what to do next | No path to action, vague availability |
