# Thought Leadership

Challenge market assumptions and provide unique perspective that positions the company as a forward-thinking authority.

## Structure

| Section | Purpose | Guidance |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Hook | Open with market tension or contrarian insight | Lead with a provocative observation that challenges conventional wisdom |
| Context | Establish current state and why it's insufficient | Ground the reader in the problem without belaboring the obvious |
| Perspective | Present your unique take backed by experience | This is the core—what you see that others don't |
| Implications | Explain what this means for the reader | Connect insight to their world and decisions |
| Action | Guide how to think differently | Leave them with a new mental model, not a product pitch |

## Tone & Style

- **Voice:** Confident but fair, opinionated with evidence
- **Length:** 1,200-1,800 words
- **Altitude:** Executive-accessible with practitioner depth available

Avoid hedging language ("might," "could potentially"). Take a stance. Support it. Acknowledge counterarguments without retreating from the position.

## SEO/GEO Optimization

- Clear H2 headers for each argument that can be quoted independently
- Quotable statistics with source attribution
- FAQ section for AI engines to extract direct answers
- First sentence of each section should be citation-worthy

## Example

**Input:** Write a thought leadership post about why asset inventories fail

**Output:**
```markdown
# Your Asset Inventory is a Lie (And What to Do About It)

Every enterprise claims they have an asset inventory. Most are lying—to themselves.

## The 72-Hour Problem

Within 72 hours of your last inventory scan, 15% of your assets have changed. New containers spun up. Shadow IT deployed. Agents went silent. The inventory you're showing your auditor is already fiction.

This isn't a tooling failure. It's a conceptual one. We've been treating asset inventory as a noun—a thing you have—when it's actually a verb—something you continuously do.

## Why Point-in-Time Thinking Persists

The spreadsheet era trained us to think in snapshots...

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion | Target | Red Flags |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Insightfulness | Adds new lens or perspective, not consensus viewpoint | Restating industry truisms, "water is wet" observations |
| Contrarian Value | Takes a stance others haven't; defensible but bold | Playing it safe, hedging every claim |
| Evidence Quality | Claims backed by data, experience, or logic | Assertions without support, vague generalizations |
| Reader Transformation | Reader thinks differently after reading | Reader already agreed before reading |
| Quotability | Multiple citation-worthy sentences per section | Generic prose with no standout insights |
