# Solution Brief

Position a capability against a specific problem, demonstrating how your approach uniquely solves a challenge the reader faces.

## Structure

| Section | Purpose | Guidance |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Challenge | Frame the problem the reader faces | Lead with pain they recognize; make them nod |
| Approach | Explain how to think about solving it | Your philosophy or method, not product features |
| Capabilities | Show what enables the solution | Specific features/functions tied to the approach |
| Outcomes | Quantify what success looks like | Metrics, customer results, business impact |
| Next Steps | Clear path to action | Single CTA appropriate to buying stage |

## Tone & Style

- **Voice:** Confident, outcome-focused, consultative
- **Length:** 2-4 pages (800-1,500 words)
- **Altitude:** Mixed—accessible to business readers with technical depth available

Balance "what" and "how"—executives care about outcomes, practitioners want to understand the mechanism.

## Design Elements

- **Callout box:** Key statistic or customer quote on page 1
- **Capability table:** 3-5 capabilities with brief descriptions
- **Outcome metrics:** Visually highlighted (larger font, icons)
- **Customer proof:** Logo + 1-sentence result

## Example

**Input:** Create a solution brief for attack surface management

**Output:**

# Close the Visibility Gap: Attack Surface Management

## The Challenge

Security teams can't protect what they can't see. Yet most organizations operate with a 15-20% visibility gap—assets that exist in the environment but don't appear in any inventory. These blind spots become entry points for attackers and compliance failures for auditors.

Traditional approaches—periodic scans, manual reconciliation, spreadsheet tracking—can't keep pace with modern environments where assets spin up and down continuously.

## The Approach

Effective attack surface management requires shifting from point-in-time snapshots to continuous discovery and correlation. Instead of asking "what do we have?" once a quarter, organizations need real-time visibility into every asset, its security posture, and its exposure.

This means:
- Aggregating data from every source that sees assets
- Correlating across sources to build a unified view
- Continuously validating coverage and identifying gaps

## Key Capabilities

| Capability | What It Does |
|------------|--------------|
| Universal Discovery | Finds assets across cloud, on-prem, and hybrid environments |
| Multi-Source Correlation | Reconciles data from 400+ integrations into single asset records |
| Coverage Gap Analysis | Identifies assets missing security controls |
| Continuous Monitoring | Updates inventory in real-time as environment changes |

## Proven Outcomes

Organizations using this approach report:
- **34% reduction** in unmanaged devices within 90 days
- **50% faster** vulnerability investigation times
- **100% audit readiness** with continuous compliance evidence

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion | Target | Red Flags |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Problem Resonance | Reader immediately recognizes the challenge | Generic problem statement, no specificity |
| Approach Clarity | Clear philosophy before diving into features | Feature-first, no "why" context |
| Capability-Outcome Link | Each capability connects to a business result | Feature list without benefits |
| Proof Quality | Specific metrics and real customer evidence | Vague claims, no quantification |
| CTA Appropriateness | Next step matches buying stage | Demo push for awareness-stage reader |
