# Event Companion

A focused handout tied to a specific event, conference, or webinar—designed to reinforce the event theme and provide a tangible takeaway.

## Structure

| Section | Purpose | Guidance |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Event Context | Connect to the event theme | Reference the event, session, or topic directly |
| Key Takeaway | One memorable insight | The single thing you want them to remember |
| Relevant Capability | How you enable the takeaway | Brief connection to your solution |
| CTA | Event-specific next step | Follow-up meeting, booth visit, session recording |

## Tone & Style

- **Voice:** Event-aligned, timely, conversational
- **Length:** 1 page (300-500 words)
- **Altitude:** Match the event audience

This is a leave-behind, not a complete sales document. It should reinforce a conversation, not replace one.

## Event-Specific Customization

For each event, customize:
- **Header/branding:** Event name and date visible
- **Theme alignment:** Content ties to event topics or sessions
- **Booth/meeting info:** Where to find you at the event
- **Follow-up hook:** Reason to continue the conversation post-event

## Design Considerations

- **Single page, single message:** Don't cram everything in
- **Scannable in 10 seconds:** Key points jump out
- **QR code:** Link to landing page or calendar booking
- **Contact info:** For follow-up conversations

## Example

**Input:** Create an event companion for RSA Conference focused on attack surface management

**Output:**
```markdown
# RSA Conference 2024

## The Attack Surface Visibility Challenge

**Session Takeaway: You Can't Protect What You Can't See**

## The 15% Problem

On average, organizations have a 15% visibility gap—assets that exist in their environment but don't appear in any security tool.

These blind spots become:
- **Entry points** for attackers
- **Findings** for auditors
- **Gaps** in compliance evidence

## The Shift: Continuous Asset Intelligence

Modern security requires moving from periodic inventory snapshots to continuous visibility:

✓ Aggregate data from every tool that sees assets
✓ Correlate and deduplicate into a single source of truth
✓ Identify coverage gaps in real-time
✓ Trigger automated response when drift occurs

## See It Live

**Stop by Booth #1234** for a demo showing:
- How we discovered 12,000 unknown assets at a Fortune 500
- Real-time coverage gap detection
- 15-minute deployment walkthrough

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion | Target | Red Flags |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Event Relevance | Clearly tied to specific event | Generic content that could be any event |
| Single Focus | One key message, not a capability dump | Trying to cover everything |
| Actionable CTA | Clear, event-specific next step | Generic "contact us" |
| Scannability | Key points visible in 10 seconds | Dense text, buried message |
| Conversation Starter | Reinforces discussion, doesn't replace it | Too much detail, self-contained |
