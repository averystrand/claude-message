# Axonius: Company Overview

## Who We Are

Axonius is the cybersecurity asset management company. Founded in 2017 by former Israel Defense Forces cybersecurity experts, we help organizations see, manage, and secure every asset in their environment.

## What We Do

The Axonius Platform aggregates and correlates data from hundreds of existing security and IT tools to provide a unified, continuously updated view of all assets—devices, users, cloud instances, and software.

Instead of building another data silo, we connect to the systems organizations already have, reconcile conflicting information, and surface the insights security and IT teams need to do their jobs.

## Why It Matters

Organizations can't protect what they can't see. Yet most operate with significant blind spots: unmanaged devices, orphaned cloud instances, forgotten user accounts. These gaps become entry points for attackers and findings for auditors.

Traditional asset management approaches—spreadsheets, periodic scans, manual reconciliation—can't keep pace with modern environments. Axonius provides continuous visibility that matches the speed of infrastructure change.
