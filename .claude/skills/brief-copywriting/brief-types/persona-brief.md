# Persona Brief

Speak directly to a specific role's daily challenges, showing how your solution changes their work for the better.

## Structure

| Section | Purpose | Guidance |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Day-in-the-Life Pain | Show you understand their reality | Describe frustrations they experience regularly |
| What Changes | Paint the picture of a better state | Focus on their workflow, not your product |
| How It Works | Explain the mechanism briefly | Just enough to make the transformation believable |
| Proof for This Role | Show peers who've succeeded | Same-role testimonials and metrics |
| Next Step | Role-appropriate CTA | Match their buying influence and interests |

## Tone & Style

- **Voice:** Empathetic, role-specific, peer-like
- **Length:** 1-2 pages (400-800 words)
- **Altitude:** Calibrated precisely to the persona

Write as if you've walked in their shoes. The reader should feel like someone who understands their job wrote this.

## Altitude Calibration

**Executive (CISO, CIO):** Strategic outcomes, risk reduction, board-level metrics, peer validation
**Director/Manager:** Operational efficiency, team productivity, cross-functional impact, resource optimization
**Practitioner:** Daily workflow improvement, specific tool benefits, time savings, reduced friction

Match not just the content but the word choice, examples, and proof points to the altitude.

## Example

**Input:** Create a persona brief for Security Operations Analysts

**Output:**

# For Security Analysts: Stop Chasing Ghosts

## Your Day Looks Like This

An alert fires. You pull up the asset in question—or try to. It's not in your CMDB. You check the endpoint tool. Not there either. Thirty minutes later, you've figured out it's a contractor laptop that was never properly onboarded.

Meanwhile, the alert queue grows.

You're not doing security work. You're doing data archaeology.

## What If It Were Different?

Imagine clicking on an alert and immediately seeing:
- Every security tool on that asset (and which ones are missing)
- Who owns it, when it was deployed, what it's connected to
- Its full history across every data source in your environment

No hunting. No cross-referencing spreadsheets. No Slack messages asking "does anyone know what this is?"

Just the context you need to make a decision in seconds, not hours.

## How It Works

We aggregate data from your existing tools—EDR, vulnerability scanners, cloud providers, identity systems, network infrastructure—and correlate it into a single, continuously updated asset record.

When you query an asset, you're not searching one system. You're searching everything, automatically correlated and enriched.

## Analysts Like You Are Saving Hours

**Reduced investigation time by 60%**
"I used to spend half my day just figuring out what an asset was. Now I click and know." — SOC Analyst, Financial Services

**Closed the endpoint gap**
"We found 2,000 assets without EDR coverage. Three were compromised." — Security Analyst, Healthcare

**Eliminated swivel-chair workflows**
"I don't have 15 tabs open anymore. Everything's in one place." — Tier 2 Analyst, Retail
