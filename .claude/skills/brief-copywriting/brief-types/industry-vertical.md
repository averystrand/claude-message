# Industry Vertical

Tailor your value proposition to industry-specific challenges, regulations, and use cases that resonate with buyers in that vertical.

## Structure

| Section | Purpose | Guidance |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Industry Context | Establish you understand their world | Reference trends, pressures, or changes specific to the vertical |
| Specific Challenges | Name the problems unique to this industry | Use their language; cite regulations or frameworks they know |
| Tailored Value | Connect your solution to their context | Show how capabilities address industry-specific needs |
| Industry Proof | Demonstrate credibility in the vertical | Logos, results, and quotes from similar organizations |
| CTA | Industry-appropriate next step | Reference industry events, peer conversations, or relevant content |

## Tone & Style

- **Voice:** Industry-informed, speaks the vertical's language
- **Length:** 2-4 pages (800-1,500 words)
- **Altitude:** Match the typical buyer in that vertical

Use industry terminology correctly. Misusing a compliance framework acronym or getting a regulatory reference wrong destroys credibility instantly.

## Industry-Specific Elements

**Regulatory/Compliance:** Reference specific frameworks (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, NERC CIP, etc.)
**Terminology:** Use industry-standard terms (patients vs. customers, production environment vs. IT infrastructure)
**Metrics:** Choose KPIs that matter to that vertical (patient safety, uptime, regulatory fines)
**Proof:** Prioritize customers from the same or adjacent industry

## Example

**Input:** Create an industry vertical brief for healthcare

# Cybersecurity Asset Management for Healthcare

## The Healthcare Security Challenge

Healthcare organizations face a unique convergence of pressures: rapidly expanding attack surfaces, strict regulatory requirements, and life-safety implications for security failures. With connected medical devices, cloud-based EHR systems, and hybrid care models, the traditional network perimeter has dissolved.

Meanwhile, threat actors increasingly target healthcare. Ransomware attacks on hospitals have delayed surgeries, diverted ambulances, and in extreme cases, contributed to patient harm.

## Challenges Unique to Healthcare

**Medical Device Blind Spots**
Connected medical devices often can't run traditional security agents. Many operate on outdated systems that can't be patched without FDA re-certification. Yet these devices connect to networks containing patient data.

**HIPAA & HITECH Compliance**
Demonstrating that every system with access to PHI has appropriate security controls requires continuous visibility—not quarterly audits.

**Clinical Environment Constraints**
Security tools that disrupt clinical workflows endanger patient safety. Solutions must work passively, without impacting device availability.

**M&A and Affiliate Complexity**
Health systems regularly acquire practices, clinics, and hospitals. Each acquisition brings unknown assets and potential vulnerabilities.

## How We Help Healthcare Organizations

| Challenge | Our Approach |
|-----------|--------------|
| Medical Device Discovery | Passive network analysis identifies devices without agents |
| HIPAA Evidence | Continuous control validation with audit-ready reports |
| Coverage Gap Analysis | Identifies clinical assets missing security controls |
| M&A Integration | Rapid asset discovery for acquired entities |

## Healthcare Organizations Trust Us

**[Major Health System]** discovered 8,000+ unmanaged devices across 12 hospitals within 60 days of deployment—including 340 medical devices with known vulnerabilities.

**[Regional Hospital Network]** reduced HIPAA audit preparation time from 6 weeks to 3 days with continuous compliance evidence.
