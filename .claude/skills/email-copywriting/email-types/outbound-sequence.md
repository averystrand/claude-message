# Outbound Sequence

Multi-touch prospecting sequences building a narrative arc across emails to earn engagement over time.

## Sequence Architecture

| Email | Purpose | Focus |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Email 1 | Problem awareness | Introduce the pain they may not fully realize; lead with insight |
| Email 2 | Solution framing | How to think about solving it; your differentiated approach |
| Email 3 | Proof point | Evidence it works; customer example or data; soft CTA |
| Email 4+ | Urgency or alternative angle | Time-based trigger, expanded use case, or different value prop |

## Tone & Style

- **Voice:** Persistent but respectful, value-additive each touch
- **Length:** 75-150 words per email
- **Altitude:** Maintain consistency across the sequence

Each email should stand alone (they may not have read previous ones) while building on the narrative for those who did.

## Thread Continuity

- Use same subject with "Re:" or evolving theme
- Reference previous emails subtly: "Last week I shared...", "Building on my earlier note..."
- Build value across the sequence—don't repeat the same pitch
- Vary proof points and angles to maintain freshness

## Cadence Guidelines

- **Typical spacing:** 3-4 days between emails
- **After no response:** Longer gaps (5-7 days) for later emails
- **Maximum sequence length:** 4-6 emails before pause

## Example

**Input:** Write a 3-email outbound sequence for IT Operations Directors at healthcare organizations

**Output:**

### Email 1: Problem Awareness
```
Subject: The 72-hour asset problem in healthcare IT

Hi [Name],

Healthcare IT teams face a unique challenge: your environment changes faster than your asset records can keep up. By the time a vulnerability scan runs, the asset inventory it's based on is already 72 hours stale.

This isn't a tooling problem—it's a data architecture problem. Point-in-time inventories can't match the pace of modern healthcare IT.

Curious if this resonates with what you're seeing at [Company]?

### Email 2: Solution Framing
```
Subject: Re: The 72-hour asset problem in healthcare IT

Hi [Name],

Following up on my note about asset inventory decay. The organizations solving this are moving from periodic snapshots to continuous correlation—pulling from every data source (EPP, EDR, cloud, MDM, CMDB) and reconciling in real-time.

The result: security and IT work from the same source of truth that reflects reality, not last month's scan.

Worth exploring how this might apply to [Company]'s environment?

### Email 3: Proof Point
```
Subject: Re: The 72-hour asset problem in healthcare IT

Hi [Name],

Quick follow-up. [Similar healthcare org] was in a similar situation—managing 50K+ assets across clinical and IT environments with no unified view.

After implementing continuous asset correlation, they reduced unmanaged device count by 34% in the first 90 days and cut vulnerability assessment time in half.

Happy to share specifics if helpful. 15 minutes this week?

Best,

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion | Target | Red Flags |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Narrative Arc | Each email builds on previous; clear progression | Repetitive messaging, no evolution |
| Standalone Value | Each email works independently | Requires reading previous emails to understand |
| Thread Continuity | Consistent subject, subtle back-references | Disconnected emails, jarring topic shifts |
| Varied Proof | Different evidence types across sequence | Same case study repeated |
| Escalating CTA | CTAs become more direct as sequence progresses | Same ask in every email |
