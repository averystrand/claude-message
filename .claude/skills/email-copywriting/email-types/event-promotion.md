# Event Promotion

Driving registration or attendance for events, webinars, and workshops by connecting the event to persona pain points.

## Structure

| Section | Purpose | Guidance |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Hook | Capture attention with relevance | Lead with why this matters to their world, not event logistics |
| What's Happening | Event details in plain language | Clear, concise description—what they'll experience |
| Why It Matters | Specific outcome for this persona | What they'll learn, gain, or be able to do differently |
| CTA | Drive registration | Clear action, minimal friction |

## Tone & Style

- **Voice:** Informative, value-forward, not hype-driven
- **Length:** 100-175 words
- **Altitude:** Match the event content to the target audience

Focus on what they'll gain, not on how great the event will be.

## Value Framing

- Tie directly to a known pain point from persona profile
- Use customer quotes for credibility when available
- Quantify the value if possible ("Learn 3 techniques to...", "Walk away with a playbook for...")
- Make the outcome tangible and immediate

## Logistics Handling

Include clearly but don't lead with:
- Date and time (with timezone)
- Format (virtual, in-person, hybrid)
- Duration
- Registration link

## Example

**Input:** Write an event promotion email for a webinar on reducing cyber insurance premiums, targeting CISOs

**Output:**
```
Subject: Cut your cyber insurance costs (without cutting coverage)

Hi [Name],

Cyber insurance premiums jumped 50% last year. Most CISOs are stuck between accepting higher costs or reducing coverage—neither is a good option.

Join us [Date] at [Time] for a 45-minute session on a third path: using asset visibility and control evidence to negotiate better terms.

**What you'll learn:**
- The 5 controls underwriters actually care about
- How to document coverage that satisfies their risk models
- Real examples from CISOs who reduced premiums 20-30%

Featuring [Speaker Name], [Title] at [Company], who'll share exactly how they built their underwriter presentation.

Virtual | 45 minutes | [Date, Time, Timezone]

Best,

```

## Reminder Email Pattern

For follow-up reminders (24-48 hours before):

```
Subject: Tomorrow: [Event topic]

Hi [Name],

Quick reminder—[Event name] is tomorrow at [Time].

We'll cover [key takeaway 1] and [key takeaway 2]. Should be valuable if you're dealing with [specific pain].

**[Add to Calendar →]** | **[Join Link →]**

See you there,
[Signature]
```

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion | Target | Red Flags |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Value Clarity | Reader knows exactly what they'll gain | Focus on speakers/sponsors instead of outcomes |
| Pain Relevance | Tied to specific persona challenge | Generic topic with no persona connection |
| Logistics Clarity | Date, time, format immediately clear | Buried or missing logistics |
| CTA Strength | Single, prominent registration action | Multiple competing CTAs, hard-to-find link |
| Brevity | 100-175 words, scannable format | Wall of text, buried key details |
