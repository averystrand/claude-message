# Single Outbound

First-touch cold emails earning attention through signal-driven relevance and insight-led credibility.

## Structure

| Section | Purpose | Guidance |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Opening | Earn the right to be read | Lead with a signal (funding, job posting, news) or contrarian insight—never company intro |
| Body | Deliver value and relevance | One clear value proposition tied to persona pain; optional proof point |
| CTA | Create low-friction next step | Ask for 15 minutes, not a demo; tie to their context |

## Tone & Style

- **Voice:** Direct, personalized, insight-led
- **Length:** 75-125 words (no scrolling required)
- **Altitude:** Match the persona—technical for practitioners, strategic for executives

The email should feel like it was written specifically for this person. Generic pain points that apply to anyone signal mass outreach.

## Opening Patterns

**Signal-driven:**
- "Noticed you're hiring for [role]—that usually means [pain]..."
- "Your recent [announcement/funding/acquisition] caught my attention..."
- "Saw [company] mentioned in [source] regarding [topic]..."

**Insight-driven:**
- "The conventional approach to [problem] actually makes [pain] worse..."
- "Most [personas] don't realize [counterintuitive truth]..."

## CTA Patterns

- "Worth 15 minutes to see if this applies to your [specific context]?"
- "Open to a quick call this week to explore?"
- "Would it help to see how [similar company] approached this?"

Avoid: "Schedule a demo," "Book a meeting," multiple CTAs.

## Example

**Input:** Write a cold outbound email to a CISO at a mid-market financial services company who just announced a SOC modernization initiative

**Output:**
```
Subject: SOC modernization without the asset blind spots

Hi [Name],

Saw the announcement about [Company]'s SOC modernization push—exciting initiative. One pattern we see derail these projects: security teams build detection around assets they know about, while 15-20% of the environment stays invisible.

The gap isn't tooling—it's that asset inventories decay faster than detection rules can keep up.

We help security teams at companies like [similar company] close that gap by correlating every asset source they have into a single view that updates continuously.

Worth 15 minutes to see if this applies to your timeline?

Best,
[Signature]

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion | Target | Red Flags |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Signal Relevance | Opening ties to specific, verifiable trigger | Generic opener, no personalization signal |
| Value Clarity | Proposition is immediately understandable | Jargon-heavy, unclear benefit |
| Persona Fit | Altitude matches recipient's role | Technical details to executives, high-level to practitioners |
| CTA Quality | Single, clear, low-friction ask | Multiple asks, "schedule a demo," vague next step |
| Brevity | 75-125 words, no scrolling | Too long, buried CTA, unnecessary context |
