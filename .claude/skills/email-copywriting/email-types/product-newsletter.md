# Product Newsletter

Regular communications about product updates, new features, and announcements—keeping customers informed and engaged.

## Structure

| Section | Purpose | Guidance |
|---------|---------|----------|
| What's New | Clear capability description | Lead with outcome, not feature name |
| Why It Matters | Connect to user benefit | Explain the problem this solves or improvement it enables |
| How to Use It | Practical guidance | Where to find it, how to get started |
| What's Next | Forward momentum | Tease upcoming work or invite feedback |

## Tone & Style

- **Voice:** Informative, helpful, not promotional
- **Length:** 150-300 words
- **Altitude:** User-focused—assumes familiarity with product but not deep technical expertise

This is for existing users. Don't sell them on the product—show them how it's getting better for them.

## Content Principles

- Lead with the outcome, not the feature name
- Balance features with user benefits
- Include practical "try this now" guidance
- Acknowledge feedback that drove improvements when applicable
- Keep promotional language minimal—let value speak for itself

## Format Options

**Single Feature Focus:**
For major releases, dedicate the email to one capability with depth.

**Multi-Feature Roundup:**
For monthly updates, brief coverage of several improvements:
- Feature 1: [2-3 sentences on what and why]
- Feature 2: [2-3 sentences on what and why]
- Feature 3: [2-3 sentences on what and why]

## Example

**Input:** Write a product newsletter announcing a new dashboard customization feature

**Output:**
```
Subject: Build the dashboard that matches how you work

Hi [Name],

Your team doesn't work the same way as every other team. Your dashboards shouldn't either.

**New: Custom Dashboard Builder**

You can now create personalized dashboards that surface exactly the data you need—no more hunting through pre-built views that don't match your workflow.

**What you can do:**
- Drag-and-drop widgets to build your layout
- Save multiple views for different use cases (daily triage, exec reporting, compliance)
- Share custom dashboards with your team

**Why it matters:**

We heard from users that the default dashboards work for general monitoring, but specific workflows—like daily vulnerability triage or weekly asset audits—needed custom views. This is our answer.

**Try it now:**
Head to Dashboards → Create Custom View to build your first one. Takes about 5 minutes.

**Coming soon:** Scheduled dashboard exports and Slack integration for dashboard alerts.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion | Target | Red Flags |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Outcome Focus | Leads with user benefit, not feature name | Feature-first, jargon-heavy announcement |
| Practical Value | Clear guidance on how to use it | No actionable next step |
| Appropriate Length | 150-300 words, scannable | Too long, too detailed, or too brief |
| User Voice | Acknowledges feedback, feels collaborative | Corporate tone, one-way broadcast |
| Forward Momentum | Teases what's next, invites engagement | Dead-end announcement with no follow-up |
