# Inbound Sequence

Nurture sequences for leads who have engaged—downloaded content, attended a webinar, requested info—moving them toward a conversation.

## Key Difference from Outbound

These leads came to you. The tone shifts from "earning attention" to "deepening engagement." You can:
- Reference their specific action (what they downloaded, attended, etc.)
- Move faster toward solution discussion
- Assume baseline awareness of the problem space

## Sequence Architecture

| Email | Purpose | Focus |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Email 1 | Acknowledge + Extend | Thank for engagement; offer related value; no hard sell |
| Email 2 | Deepen the Value | Expand on the topic they engaged with; add new insight |
| Email 3 | Connect to Their World | Tie the content to their specific situation; soft CTA |
| Email 4+ | Solution Bridge | Transition from content to conversation; direct CTA |

## Tone & Style

- **Voice:** Helpful, consultative, not pushy
- **Length:** 100-200 words per email
- **Altitude:** Match the content they engaged with

They've shown interest. Don't squander it by immediately pivoting to a sales pitch.

## Opening Patterns

- "Thanks for downloading [resource]—hope you found [specific insight] useful..."
- "Following up on the [webinar/event]—wanted to share a related resource..."
- "Noticed you've been exploring [topic area] on our site..."

## Progression Strategy

Start with content value, gradually introduce solution relevance:
1. Pure value (related content, additional insights)
2. Contextual value (how others in their role use this)
3. Applied value (how this connects to their specific challenges)
4. Conversation (direct offer to discuss)

## Example

**Input:** Write a 3-email inbound sequence for a Security Analyst who downloaded a whitepaper on attack surface management

**Output:**

### Email 1: Acknowledge + Extend
```
Subject: More on attack surface visibility

Hi [Name],

Thanks for grabbing the attack surface management guide. One insight that often sparks follow-up questions: the gap between what vulnerability scanners see and what's actually exposed isn't a scanning problem—it's an asset problem.

If you're interested in going deeper, this companion piece covers the correlation techniques that close that gap: [link]

Let me know if you have questions.

### Email 2: Deepen the Value
```
Subject: Re: More on attack surface visibility

Hi [Name],

Following up with a practical angle. Security analysts we work with often struggle with the same thing: investigating a vulnerability finding only to discover the asset isn't even in their inventory.

This 5-minute video walks through how one team cut that investigation time by 60%: [link]

Might be useful as you're thinking through this.

### Email 3: Connect to Their World
```
Subject: Re: More on attack surface visibility

Hi [Name],

Quick question—are you dealing with the asset visibility challenge in a specific context? Cloud sprawl, M&A integration, compliance scope?

Depending on where the gap hurts most, I can point you to relevant examples from organizations in similar situations.

Or if it's easier, happy to hop on a quick call to talk through what you're seeing at [Company].

Best,

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion | Target | Red Flags |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Engagement Reference | Clearly ties to their specific action | Generic follow-up, no mention of what they did |
| Value-First | Each email offers something useful before asking | Immediate sales pitch, no added value |
| Gradual Progression | Builds from content to conversation naturally | Jumps to demo request in email 1 |
| Consultative Tone | Feels like a helpful colleague, not a salesperson | Pushy language, artificial urgency |
| Personalization | References their role, industry, or likely challenges | One-size-fits-all messaging |
