# Segment A: Fintech & Financial Services

## Attributes
- **Verticals:** Fintech, Payments, Banking, Fraud & Identity, Open Finance
- **Regions:** Global (with strong presence in North America, UK, MENA)
- **Company Size:** Mid-Market to Enterprise (e.g., Plaid, Wise, Modern Treasury)

## Relevant Characteristics
Companies in this segment sell "invisible" trust-based products where the core value is data processing (payments, KYC, risk scores) rather than a UI.
* **Trust & Security Paramount:** They face high scrutiny regarding data privacy and compliance; showing "real" data in a demo is risky, but "fake" data looks unconvincing.
* **Complex Data Flows:** Their value prop involves multi-step backend logic (e.g., verifying an identity, clearing a transaction) that is impossible to visualize with standard screenshots.

## Relevant Behaviors
These organizations often struggle to differentiate because their "product" is code; they rely heavily on trust and reliability signals.
* **Compliance-Driven Sales:** Buying committees always include security/compliance officers who need to see "under the hood" (audit logs, auth headers) to verify the tech is robust.
* **Skeptical Buyers:** Their target audience (often other developers or financial institutions) instantly rejects "vaporware" or hypothetical marketing fluff.

## Value Messages
**Visualize the Invisible Risk & Trust**
Make abstract concepts like "fraud detection" or "identity verification" tangible by simulating the backend decision logic and risk scores in real-time, proving the algorithm works.

**Secure, Compliant Demos Without Production Risk**
Use intelligent mocking to show realistic PII or transaction data without ever exposing actual customer data or touching live production environments, satisfying strict compliance teams.

**Unified "Bank-Grade" Storytelling**
Ensure every rep tells a consistent, compliant narrative across complex product suites (e.g., payments + lending + data), preventing regulatory slip-ups or off-brand promises.

## Potential Objections
* **Data Security:** "We cannot put our real API keys or customer data into a third-party tool." (Counter: Coast supports smart mocking and local execution options).
* **Complexity:** "Our flows are too complex/custom to template." (Counter: Coast handles conditional logic, webhooks, and multi-step orchestration specifically for this).
