# Segment B: Enterprise & Platform Organizations

## Attributes
- **Verticals:** Enterprise SaaS, Telecommunications, Core Infrastructure (e.g., Fiserv, Galileo, Twilio)
- **Regions:** Global
- **Company Size:** Large Enterprise (1,000+ Employees)

## Relevant Characteristics
Large organizations with diverse product portfolios where "GTM alignment" is a massive challenge; different teams often use disparate, disjointed demo tools.
* **Fragmented Narratives:** With multiple product lines, it is difficult to present a unified "platform" story; sales reps often struggle to cross-sell or explain adjacent products.
* **High Governance Needs:** Requires enterprise-grade control over who can edit, share, and view demos to protect brand integrity and security.

## Relevant Behaviors
These companies face long sales cycles with large buying committees and heavily utilized Solutions Engineering resources.
* **SE Resource Strain:** High volume of demo requests creates bottlenecks; SEs are often pulled into low-value discovery calls just to click through a product.
* **Champion Enablement:** The deal often hinges on an internal champion selling the solution up the chain to the C-suite in their absence.

## Value Messages
**Unify the Multi-Product Platform Story**
Move from fragmented "team-owned products" to "organization-built solutions" by creating a shared demo library that stitches together different APIs into one seamless customer journey.

**Scale SE Impact & Governance**
Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and SSO to securely scale demo capabilities to hundreds of sellers, ensuring every rep stays "on script" while freeing SEs for strategic architecture work.

**Arm the Internal Champion**
Provide shareable, interactive assets that allow your champion to present the business case to the C-suite with the same fidelity as your best SE, multiplying your reach within the account.

## Potential Objections
* **Integration Effort:** "It will take too long to integrate our legacy stack." (Counter: Coast is non-intrusive and can mock legacy backends to speed up GTM without touching the monolith).
* **Procurement/Compliance:** "We have strict vendor onboarding." (Counter: Coast is SOC 2 compliant, enterprise-ready, and already trusted by major banks/fintechs).
