# Segment C: High-Growth API-First Startups

## Attributes
- **Verticals:** Developer Tools, B2B SaaS, Embedded Finance (YC / VC-backed)
- **Regions:** North America, Europe
- **Company Size:** SMB to Mid-Market (<500 Employees)

## Relevant Characteristics
Fast-moving companies (often YC alumni) where engineering time is the most expensive resource; they need to punch above their weight class.
* **Engineering Scarcity:** Engineers are focused on shipping product, not building sales demos; "homegrown" demo tools are a distraction and technical debt.
* **Speed is Survival:** They need to close deals fast and shorten sales cycles to hit aggressive growth targets.

## Relevant Behaviors
These companies often sell to developers (DevEx is critical) and are looking for "leverage" to make their lean sales team effective.
* **"Fake it til you make it":** Often selling features or integrations that are on the roadmap but not fully built; they need to show "vision" without vaporware.
* **Product-Led Ambitions:** Strong desire to put the product on the website (PLG) to let the product sell itself and qualify leads automatically.

## Value Messages
**Zero Engineering Overhead**
Stop wasting expensive dev hours on demo maintenance. Save >$100k in engineering costs and let GTM teams build their own assets instantly.

**Sell the Roadmap Today**
Prototype and demo new use cases or integrations before they are fully coded, allowing you to validate demand and close deals on "future" features now.

**Turn Your Website into a Lead Engine**
Embed interactive sandboxes on your marketing site to engage developer buyers early, increasing qualified lead conversion by 50% without a "contact sales" wall.

## Potential Objections
* **Build vs. Buy:** "Our engineers can just build a demo environment." (Counter: It distracts from core product, breaks often, and costs more in maintenance than buying Coast).
* **Cost:** "We are too small for a platform." (Counter: The cost of losing one deal due to a bad demo or wasting one week of engineering time outweighs the license).
