# Messaging House - Portfolio

The Portfolio defines what we offer and how it is structured.

Use this section to understand the shape, hierarchy, and scope of our offerings so messaging stays at the correct altitude and references the right products and solutions at the right time.

## Messaging Blocks

### Portfolio Overview

Coast is a unified API Go-to-Market Platform designed to replace disjointed demo tools with a single, cohesive environment. The platform functions as an all-in-one toolkit that combines an AI-Powered Builder for creating scenarios, a Simulation Engine (frontend + backend logic) for executing them, and a Distribution Suite for sharing via personalized links or website embeds. It is a single product platform with tiered capabilities for Enterprise security and scale, serving distinct use cases across the revenue team.

### Product Details

Products are the canonical units of offering within the portfolio.Reference products intentionally and only when they are relevant to the scenario, persona, or use case.When specific products are related to your task workflow, extract the respective profile in /messaging/products/ for in-depth messaging.

## Rules

- Portfolio defines altitude — use it to speak broadly about the offering
- Products define scope — introduce them only when specificity is required
- Capabilities justify value — use them to explain why outcomes are achievable
- Technical details support credibility — include them selectively and last

## Guidelines

- Avoid long feature lists; introduce capabilities sparingly when they're additive to a value-led narrative
- Prefer buyer outcomes and use cases over product mechanics
- Elevate product value to meaningful, measurable business or technical impact
