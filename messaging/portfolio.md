# Messaging House - Portfolio

The Portfolio defines what we offer and how it is structured.

Use this section to understand the shape, hierarchy, and scope of our offerings so messaging stays at the correct altitude and references the right products and solutions at the right time.

## Messaging Blocks

### Portfolio Overview

[Instructions:
Describe the high-level structure of your offering. This may be a single product, a multi-product portfolio, a platform with add-ons, or a combination of products and services.

Claude will use this to determine whether to speak at the platform, portfolio, or product level in messaging.]

[Tips:
– Prioritize structure over detail
– Clarify relationships between products (core vs add-on, platform vs application, bundled vs standalone)
– Avoid feature-level discussion here]

[Format:
1 short paragraph describing the portfolio structure and relationships]

### Product Details

Products are the canonical units of offering within the portfolio.

Reference products intentionally and only when they are relevant to the scenario, persona, or use case.

[Instructions:
Document each product as a discrete profile.

Claude will use this to introduce or reference offerings when specificity is required.]

[Tips:
– Include context that is relevant to messaging, not every product detail
- Be explicit and clear about what the product is capable of
- Focus value messaging on differentiation]

[Format:
For each product, include:

- Product Name: Official product name
- Description: a concise explanation of what the product does and who it is for
- Positioning Statement: describe how this product fits in the market
- Critical Capabilities: list the capabilities that drive value for this product
- Technical Details: include technical context only when it affects buying, usage, or credibility
- Link (optional): link to any public-facing web properties for the product for additional reference
- Documentation (optional): link to any public-facing documentation for additional reference]

### Use Cases

Use cases are the ways the product is applied in practice.

Use these to ground messaging in real scenarios of jobs-to-be-done and desired outcomes.

[Instructions:
Document repeatable, outcome-oriented scenarios where the portfolio delivers meaningful and measurable value. Use cases may span multiple products or apply to a single product.

Claude will use these as tip of the spear messaging.]

[Tips:
– Aim for use cases that are both hands-on practical for practitioners and valuable to the business
- When you have a lot of use cases, try to logically group them to avoid messaging sprawl]

[Format:
For each use case, include:

- Use Case Name: a clear, descriptive label for how the product is used
- Description: explain the problem being solved and the desired outcome
- Applicable Products: specify which products in the portfolio apply to this use case
- Approach: describe your unique method for solving this use case
- Why We're Different: explain why this use case is only solvable by you]

## Rules

- Portfolio defines altitude — use it to speak broadly about the offering
- Products define scope — introduce them only when specificity is required
- Capabilities justify value — use them to explain why outcomes are achievable
- Technical details support credibility — include them selectively and last

## Guidelines

- Avoid long feature lists; introduce capabilities sparingly when they're additive to a value-led narrative
- Prefer buyer outcomes and use cases over product mechanics
- Elevate product value to meaningful, measurable business or technical impact
