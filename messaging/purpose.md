# Messaging House: Purpose

Our Purpose is why our company exists in the market. 

Use this section as root context to shape our POV and our ambition across our messaging. This section should influence framing and direction, not be quoted verbatim unless explicitly requested.

## Messaging Blocks

### Company Vision
[Instructions: 
Describe the future world your company is driving towards. Think of this as the North Star of your positioning and messaging. 

Claude will use this to anchor aspirational language and long-arc narratives.]

[Tips: 
– Focus on external market forces
– Be directional and opinionated
– Avoid generic phrases that could be anyone
]

[Format:
1–2 sentences describing a changed future state]


### Mission Statement
[Instructions: 
Define the concrete drumbeat your company hits every day. Value messaging will show up later, keep this elevated to action statements.

Claude will use this to credibly ground your North Star vision.]

[Tips:
– Emphasize verbs and ongoing behavior
– Align to the vision with the how
– Avoid abstract language]

[Format:
1–2 sentences describing a continuous discipline]

## Usage Guidelines

- Use the Company Vision to shape aspirational framing, narrative arc, and industry-level language
- Use Mission Statement to ground claims in practicality and credibility
- Do not restate Purpose verbatim unless explicitly instructed 
- When in tension with other Messaging House elements, Purpose sets the direction, not the details
