# Messaging House - Profile

Our Profile is the foundation of who we are as a company, tuned for various distribution channels. 

Use this section to introduce the company accurately and consistently in external settings. 

## Messaging Blocks

### Foundation
[Instructions:
Document the core facts about the company such as the type of business, market space, founders, investors, key customers, revenue/fundraising milestones, supported regions, verticals in focus, regulations in play, etc.

Claude will use this purely as a fact sheet.]

[Format:
Bulleted list]


### Boilerplate Statement
[Instructions:
Provide the canonical About statement used across press releases, social profiles, partner listings, and marketplaces. This should be reusable verbatim.

Claude will use this as the default company description when a formal introduction is required.]

[Tips:
– Write in third person
– Keep it concise and authoritative
– Avoid campaign-specific phrasing
]

[Format:
1 short paragraph suitable for copy-paste
(Optional): write a short, medium, and long version for various uses]

### Marketplace Statement
[Instructions:
Describe the company as it should appear in marketplace listings or partner catalogs. This should be more product and outcome-oriented than the boilerplate, while remaining factual.

Claude will use this when generating content for third-party marketplaces, listings, or directories where readers expect a practical understanding of what the product does and why it's valuable.]

[Tips:
– Emphasize primary use cases and measurable business outcomes
– Use clear, accessible language aligned to buyer expectations
– Avoid exaggerated claims, competitive language, or narrative framing
]

[Format:
1–2 sentences with 3-5 bullet points optimized for listing views]

## Usage Guidelines

- Use the Foundation when company facts are required
- Use the Boilerplate Statement for formal or press-style introductions
- Use the Marketplace Statement for listings, catalogs, and partner directories
- Do not introduce differentiation, a unique POV, or belief with this layer of messaging
