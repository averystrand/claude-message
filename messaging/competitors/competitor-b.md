# Competitor B: Fern / Stainless (DevEx Tools)

## Attributes
- **Type:** DIY / Adjacent Vendor (Developer Experience)
- **Current Position:** Visionary / Emerging (in SDK Generation)
- **Our Approach:** Target & Education (Sales vs. Implementation)

## Description
Fern and Stainless are developer tooling platforms focused on generating high-quality SDKs (Software Development Kits) and documentation from API specifications. They excel at solving the "integration" problem by making it easier for a developer to write code against an API once they have decided to use it.

Customers often choose these vendors believing that "good documentation is enough" to sell an API. They assume that if the SDK is clean, the product will sell itself. However, this ignores the commercial reality that decision-makers (both business and technical) often need to understand the *value* and *workflow* before they ever open a terminal to install an SDK.

## SWOT Analysis
- **Strengths:** Produces high-quality, developer-loved code artifacts; strengthens the post-sale implementation experience; builds credibility with engineers.
- **Weaknesses:** Zero utility for non-technical stakeholders; requires the prospect to actively "work" (write code) to see value; does not support a narrative-driven sales motion.
- **Opportunities:** Coast can actually complement these tools (Coast for the "Why", Fern/Stainless for the "How").
- **Threats:** Companies with limited budgets may view "DevEx" and "Demo" as competing line items.

## Why Customers Choose Us
[cite_start]Customers realize that "docs & slides don’t close deals" and that relying on a prospect to read documentation forces them to "decode" the value on their own[cite: 12]. [cite_start]Coast is chosen to bridge the gap *before* the integration starts, providing a "try before you build" experience that SDK generators cannot offer[cite: 9].

## Differentiation Messages
**Sales Velocity vs. Implementation Speed**
Fern and Stainless help developers build *after* they buy; Coast helps sales teams close the deal *so* they can buy. [cite_start]We collapse the time-to-value by showing the completed workflow instantly[cite: 136].

**Narrative vs. Reference**
Documentation is a reference manual; Coast is a storytelling engine. [cite_start]We allow you to guide the prospect through a curated "happy path" rather than dumping them into a comprehensive library of endpoints[cite: 24].

**Engage the Whole Committee**
SDKs only speak to the coder. [cite_start]Coast provides a multi-view experience that sells the business value to the VP *and* the technical realism to the Architect simultaneously[cite: 68].
