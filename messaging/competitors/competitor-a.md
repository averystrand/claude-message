# Competitor A: Walnut (and Generic Screen Capture Tools)

## Attributes
- **Type:** Vendor (General Interactive Demo Platform)
- **Current Position:** Leader (in broad B2B SaaS)
- **Our Approach:** Differentiate (Specialized vs. Generic)

## Description
Walnut is a market leader in the interactive demo space, designed primarily for UI-heavy SaaS applications (like CRMs or HRIS). They use screen capturing technology to scrape the DOM (frontend) of an application, allowing marketing and sales teams to create guided, annotation-heavy walkthroughs of the user interface.

Customers often choose Walnut because it is a well-known brand with a low barrier to entry for non-technical marketing teams who want to show off a pretty dashboard. However, for API-first companies, Walnut fails to capture the "invisible" value, as it cannot simulate backend logic, API responses, or data transformations—it is strictly a frontend capture tool.

## SWOT Analysis
- **Strengths:** Strong brand recognition; excellent "no-code" editor for visual/UI changes; great for marketing website embeds.
- **Weaknesses:** Cannot demonstrate API connectivity or backend logic; demos are "static" snapshots rather than dynamic simulations; fails to engage technical buyers who want to see code.
- **Opportunities:** Great for the "business user" view, but leaves the "technical user" view empty.
- **Threats:** As SaaS products become more technical/headless, frontend-only capture becomes less relevant.

## Why Customers Choose Us
API companies choose Coast because Walnut cannot visualize the "under-the-hood" details that technical buyers demand. While Walnut shows the *result* on a screen, Coast shows the *process*—the API calls, webhooks, and data flow—that actually drives the value.

## Differentiation Messages
**Visualize the Backend, Not Just the UI**
Unlike Walnut, which only scrapes the frontend interface, Coast simulates the entire stack—including data processing, transformations, and auth headers—to prove the technical reality of the product.

**Dynamic Data vs. Static Screenshots**
Walnut relies on static HTML captures; Coast allows for dynamic variables and logic, meaning if a prospect enters data in Step 1, it actually flows through to Step 2.

**For Technical Buyers, Not Just Users**
Walnut is built for showing software to end-users; Coast is built for selling technology to developers and architects who need to inspect the payload, not just the pixels.
