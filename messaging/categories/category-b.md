# Category B: Technical Sales Enablement

## Attributes
- **Maturity:** Established (but evolving)
- **Coverage:** Specialized (Focused on SEs/Pre-Sales)
- **Related Categories:** Sales Content Management, Demo Automation, Pre-Sales Tooling

## Category Overview
Tools and platforms designed specifically to assist Solutions Engineers and technical sales teams in proving technology value (POCs, Sandboxes, RFPs).

## Our Solution
A "demo automation" workbench that allows SEs to build reusable, stable demo environments that AEs can present, removing the burden of constant custom POC builds.

## Current Position
**Visionary** — Redefining the SE toolkit from "managing environments" to "automating storytelling."

## Strategic Aim
**Consume** — Replace ad-hoc tools (Postman collections, local hosts, slide decks) to become the primary workspace for technical demonstrations.
