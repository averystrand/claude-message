## Attributes

- **Related Categories:** Lead Generation, Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO), Marketing Automation

## Category Overview
Software that helps companies use their product as the primary vehicle for acquiring, activating, and retaining customers (e.g., free trials, self-serve onboarding).

## Our Solution
We enable "simulated PLG" for companies that are too complex for a real free trial, allowing them to offer a friction-free "test drive" experience on their marketing site.

## Current Position
**New Entrant / Enabler** — Unlocking PLG motions for "hard-to-trial" API products that previously could only sell via sales-led motions.

## Strategic Aim
**Differentiate** — Position "Simulated PLG" as a faster, safer alternative to engineering-heavy "Freemium" tiers for complex backend products.
