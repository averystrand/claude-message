# Category A: Interactive Demo Software

## Attributes
- **Maturity:** Growing (Rapidly adopting in SaaS)
- **Coverage:** Broad (Spans Marketing, Sales, Product)
- **Related Categories:** Sales Enablement, Product Marketing, Digital Adoption Platforms

## Category Overview
Software that enables companies to create "guided" or simulated versions of their product experience for prospects to explore without a live account.

## Our Solution
We provide a specialized interactive demo platform that goes beyond frontend clicking to simulate the backend logic, API responses, and data flows essential for selling technical products.

## Current Position
**Challenger (Specialized)** — Challenging generic "frontend-only" leaders (like Walnut/Navattic) by owning the "Technical/API" niche they cannot serve.

## Strategic Aim
**Differentiate & Lead** — Establish "API Demos" as a distinct, superior sub-category where frontend capture is considered insufficient.
