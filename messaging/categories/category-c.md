# Category C: API Developer Experience (DevEx)

## Attributes
- **Maturity:** Peak (High attention in API economy)
- **Coverage:** Specialized (Focused on Developer Adoption)
- **Related Categories:** API Documentation, SDK Generation, API Gateways

## Category Overview
The set of tools and practices (docs, SDKs, sandboxes) used to make it easy for external developers to understand and integrate with an API.

## Our Solution
We provide the "visual" layer of DevEx—interactive sandboxes that sit alongside documentation to show developers *what* to build before they read *how* to build it.

## Current Position
**Adjacent / Partner** — We sit next to documentation (like ReadMe) and SDKs (like Fern) as the "Try It" layer.

## Strategic Aim
**Converge** — Become an expected standard component of the modern developer portal (Docs + SDK + Coast Demo).
