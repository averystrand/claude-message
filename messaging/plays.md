# Messaging House - Plays

THe Plays define repeatable, scenario-driven sales and marketing motions.

Use this section to assemble targeted messaging when specific conditions, initiatives, or buyer situations are present.

## Messaging Blocks

### Play Profiles

[Instructions:
Document each Play as a reusable messaging narrative tied to a specific buyer situation or initiative. Plays should explain when the motion applies, why it matters, and how value is created.

Claude will use this as focused messaging when the scenario matches the defined conditions, cross-referencing messaging across the Position, Proposition, Portfolio, Proof, and People based on the context.]

[Tips:
– Ensure that the compelling events are truly compelling, impacting priorities and budgets
– A single Play may apply to multiple audiences, and may span multiple portfolio products - be clear about the mapping]

[Format:
For each Play, include:

- Name: A clear, action-oriented label describing the motion
- Trigger Conditions: Describe the events, pressures, or realizations that make this play relevant now
- Canonical Scenario: Provide a short, memorable example that illustrates the situation this play addresses. This could be hypothetical or real. 
- Solution Set: Describe the nature of your solution and how it maps to your portfolio.
- Value Measures: Detail the quantitative and qualitative measures the solution is evaluated against.
- Play Pitch: Outline a play-specific pitch that explains the problem and solution. 
- Portfolio Alignment (optional): Specify which products this play applies to. 
- People Alignment (optional): Specify which segments and personas this play applies to.]

## Rules

- Prioritize the Play when the messaging is meant to be targeted to specific conditions
- Deprioritize the Play when messaging is meant to elevate above any single solution or product

## Guidelines

- Adapt messaging language to the target audience and customer journey stage
