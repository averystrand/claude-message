# Messaging House - Plays

THe Plays define repeatable, scenario-driven sales and marketing motions.

Use this section to assemble targeted messaging when specific conditions, initiatives, or buyer situations are present.

## Messaging Blocks

### Play Profiles

Wake the Dead
Name: Wake the Dead (Re-engagement)

Trigger Conditions: Accounts stalled for 3+ months; prospects who ghosted after an initial demo; closed-lost deals from previous quarters where "timing" was the objection.

Canonical Scenario: A prospect saw a static demo 6 months ago, liked the concept, but the deal stalled due to lack of budget or implementation bandwidth.

Solution Set: Re-introduce Coast with a focus on new efficiency features (AI Demo Builder) that lower the barrier to entry. Offer a low-friction "look" rather than a formal sales call.

Value Measures: Re-opened pipeline revenue; Response rate on stalled threads.

Play Pitch: "Circling back — since we last spoke, we launched our AI-powered builder. It makes building personalized demos 10x faster with less effort. I went ahead and built a draft for [Company] using the new engine. Want me to send the link so you can see the difference?"

Portfolio Alignment: Coast Platform (AI Builder update)

People Alignment: Sales, Account Executives

The Sandwich Method
Name: The Sandwich Method (Multi-Voice Outreach)

Trigger Conditions: A high-value prospect goes dark after the first outreach or initial demo; lack of response to a single rep's cadence.

Canonical Scenario: Rep A sends an email that gets opened but ignored. Rep B (a peer or manager) replies to the same thread to add social proof or a different angle, "sandwiching" the prospect between two valid perspectives.

Solution Set: Collaborative outreach leveraging team credibility to restart the conversation.

Value Measures: Response rate lift; Meeting booked rate.

Play Pitch:

Rep A (Initial): "Wanted to follow up on the demo we shared — any thoughts on how this handles your API complexity?"

Rep B (The Nudge): "Jumping in here — I’ve seen teams like [Competitor/Peer] run into the exact same issue you mentioned. I’d be happy to show you specifically how they solved the 'empty state' problem using Coast."

Rep A (The Close): "looping back..."

Portfolio Alignment: Sales Enablement

People Alignment: SDRs, AEs (paired)

Social Signal
Name: Social Signal (LinkedIn Likes)

Trigger Conditions: A prospect likes, comments on, or shares a Coast post, a founder's post, or general content regarding API sales, DevEx, or technical storytelling.

Canonical Scenario: A VP of Product at an API-first fintech likes a post about "why static docs are failing."

Solution Set: Immediate, contextual outbound that bridges their social engagement to a direct question about their current workflow.

Value Measures: Connection acceptance rate; Reply rate.

Play Pitch: "Saw you liked our post on the 'API Sales Paradox' — curious, does your team currently build custom engineering POCs for demos, or are you relying on static docs today? We're seeing most teams trying to move away from the slide deck."

Portfolio Alignment: Marketing, Sales

People Alignment: Growth, SDRs

Donuts & Discovery
Name: Donuts & Discovery (Incentivized Meeting)

Trigger Conditions: Net-new outreach to cold accounts; high-value prospects who are difficult to book; pre-event meeting setting.

Canonical Scenario: A target account fits the ICP perfectly but has high gatekeepers. You need a low-friction "give" to get 15 minutes of their time.

Solution Set: A tangible incentive (coffee/donuts) paired with a high-value, short discovery/demo session.

Value Measures: Meeting hold rate; Cost per opportunity.

Play Pitch: "I know your time is tight. I'd be happy to buy you coffee (or donuts) on us while we show you how Coast can auto-personalize your demo flow. Quick 15 min? I'll send the card instantly once we book."

Portfolio Alignment: Sales

People Alignment: SDRs, AEs

Love Bomb
Name: Love Bomb (Account Multi-threading)

Trigger Conditions: A Champion goes cold; a deal is stuck in single-threaded limbo; need to wake up in-pipeline deals by expanding influence.

Canonical Scenario: You have one contact who loves Coast, but they've stopped replying. You need to activate their boss or their technical counterpart to reignite urgency.

Solution Set: Targeted, simultaneous outreach to the wider buying committee (Product, Engineering, Sales Leadership) referencing the specific value for their role.

Value Measures: Account penetration; Deal velocity.

Play Pitch: (To the Boss/Peer) "We've been discussing with [Champion Name] how to remove the engineering bottleneck for demos. I wanted to share this specific view for you — it shows how we handle [Compliance/Auth/Security] so your team doesn't have to build custom sandboxes."

Portfolio Alignment: Sales Enablement, Enterprise

People Alignment: AEs, SEs

The Event Sweep
Name: The Event Sweep (Conference Dominance)

Trigger Conditions: Upcoming industry conference (e.g., Money20/20) with high density of API-first buyers; secured attendee list or networking portal access.

Canonical Scenario: Approaching a major fintech event. Instead of generic "stop by our booth," the team runs a coordinated 3-phase attack: Pre-event booking via personalized links, onsite rapid-capture, and immediate post-event recapture.

Solution Set:

Pre-Event: "I built a demo for you."

Onsite: "Calendar invite sent immediately."

Post-Event: Tiered follow-up based on engagement.

Value Measures: Pre-booked meetings; Onsite demos given; Post-event conversion to Opportunity.

Play Pitch:

Pre-Event: "I’ll be at [Event]. I’ve actually pre-built a Coast demo environment specifically for [Prospect Company] to show how you could demo your [Product Name] API live. Want to see it at the booth? I'll send a calendar invite."

Onsite: "Great chatting. I'm sending the calendar invite for next Tuesday right now with your personal demo link inside. Did you get it?"

Post-Event (Tier 1): "Great meeting you. Here is the link to that personalized workflow we looked at. I've added the [Feature] we discussed."
