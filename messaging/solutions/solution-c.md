## Solution Description
Traditional B2B marketing relies on "gated" content or static whitepapers, creating high friction that delays prospect education. Buyers want to experience the product *before* they talk to a human, but API companies struggle to offer self-serve trials without complex integration work.

Coast enables marketing teams to embed interactive "live sandboxes" directly onto websites, blogs, or campaigns. These guided experiences allow visitors to interact with the API value proposition immediately, resulting in better-educated leads who convert at significantly higher rates.

## Unique Approach
Coast allows marketers to deploy product-led experiences anywhere on the web without needing engineering resources to maintain a live production sandbox.

* **Frictionless "Try It Now":** Embed fully interactive workflows that simulate the integration process, allowing prospects to "test drive" the API instantly.
* **Intent-Based Analytics:** Track exactly how prospects interact with the demo—capturing clicks, time spent, and features explored—to score leads based on actual behavior rather than just form fills.

## Value Messages
**3x Lead Qualification**
Visitors who interact with an embedded demo are 3x more likely to become qualified buyers compared to those who view static pages.

**Accelerate Funnel Velocity**
Prospects who self-educate via interactive demos enter the sales process with a deeper understanding, moving through the funnel 30% faster.

**Control the Narrative**
Ensure consistent product storytelling from the first marketing touchpoint to the final sales demo by using the same underlying demo assets.
