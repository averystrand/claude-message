- **Applicable Products:** Coast Platform

## Solution Description
The "sale" doesn't end when the contract is signed; for API products, the gap between signing and "going live" can be months of complex integration work. New customers often struggle with dense documentation, leading to slow adoption and a high burden on implementation teams to hand-hold developers.

Coast helps Customer Success teams accelerate this phase by providing interactive "implementation guides" that walk customer developers through the exact steps required to integrate. Instead of reading about an endpoint, customers can see the data flow in a simulated environment, clarifying requirements and reducing friction.

## Unique Approach
Coast turns the demo platform into a post-sales education tool, creating a seamless bridge between the promise of the sales cycle and the reality of deployment.

* **Interactive Walkthroughs:** CS teams can send tailored links that guide customers through specific configurations or workflows, acting as a visual companion to technical docs.
* **Standardized "Golden Paths":** Provide a prescribed, optimized flow for testing and integration, ensuring customers avoid common pitfalls during their setup.

## Value Messages
**Accelerate "Go-Live"**
Help customers visualize the end-state integration immediately, enabling them to launch faster and realize value sooner.

**Reduce Implementation Costs**
Replace high-touch engineering support meetings with self-guided interactive assets that answer "how does this work?" visually.

**Maintain Momentum**
Keep excitement high post-signature by providing a tangible sandbox environment while the real integration is being built.
