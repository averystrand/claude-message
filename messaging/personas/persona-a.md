# Persona A: Solutions Engineer (SE)

## Attributes
- **Job Titles:** Solutions Engineer, Sales Engineer, Solutions Architect, Technical Pre-Sales
- **Role in the Buying Process:** Influencer, Champion (often the primary user/evaluator)
- **Role in the Product:** Owner, Administrator (Builds the demos)

## Roles & Responsibilities
The technical bridge between product capability and customer value; they are responsible for proving the technology works during the sales cycle.
* **Demo Creation:** Building and maintaining demo environments, often requiring custom engineering or scripting.
* **Technical Validation:** answering deep technical questions (auth, security, integration) to win over the buyer’s engineering team.
* **Sales Support:** joining calls to run the "technical" part of the presentation.

## Relevant Signals
* **Backlog Burnout:** Complaining about a queue of demo requests or spending nights/weekends building custom POCs for prospects.
* **Environment Anxiety:** Frustration with local environments breaking ("it worked on my machine") or sandbox downtime during live calls.
* **Repetitive Work:** Doing the same "intro" demo over and over for unqualified leads instead of working on complex, strategic deals.

## Value Messages
**Stop Wrangling, Start Architecting**
Shift from "duct-taping" local environments and maintaining fragile scripts to building robust, reusable scenarios in a stable cloud platform with 99.99% uptime.

**The "Solutions Amplifier"**
Build a demo once and let every Account Executive use it infinitely. Scale your technical expertise across the entire sales team without having to join every single call.

**Focus on the "Hard-to-See" Wins**
Spend your time visualizing complex backend value (webhooks, payloads) that actually wins the technical validation, rather than rebuilding generic frontend flows for every prospect.

## Potential Objections
* **Technical Control:** "I prefer my local setup because I have full control/it's more flexible." (Counter: Coast allows deep logic control/scripting but removes the maintenance/stability risk).
* **Realism:** "Mocks aren't real enough for my buyers." (Counter: Coast supports live API execution and intelligent mocking that includes real headers/latency for authenticity).
