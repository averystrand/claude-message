# Persona B: Account Executive (AE)

## Attributes
- **Job Titles:** Account Executive, Sales Manager, Enterprise Sales Rep
- **Role in the Buying Process:** Buyer (Budget Owner for small teams), Champion
- **Role in the Product:** End User (Presenting/Sharing demos)

## Roles & Responsibilities
The revenue driver responsible for closing business; they manage the relationship and the commercial narrative.
* **Discovery & Demo:** Qualifying prospects and demonstrating value early to secure interest.
* **Pipeline Velocity:** Moving deals from "interested" to "closed" as fast as possible.
* **Relationship Management:** Building trust with stakeholders and providing them with materials to sell internally.

## Relevant Signals
* **"Demo Lag":** Complaining that deals cool off because they have to wait days/weeks for an SE to be available for a demo.
* **Hypothetical Selling:** Struggling to explain technical concepts ("imagine if...") and losing prospect engagement as a result.
* **Dependency Frustration:** Feeling helpless because they cannot show the product themselves without technical hand-holding.

## Value Messages
**Sell Without Handoffs**
Gain the independence to run flawless, personalized demos on your own, allowing you to merge discovery and demo into one call and close deals faster.

**The "Red Carpet" Treatment for Everyone**
Instantly generate a demo that uses the prospect’s name, data, and branding—making every lead feel like a strategic account without asking engineering for a favor.

**Win the Internal Champion**
Don't just leave a slide deck; send a trackable, interactive demo link that your champion can show their boss, letting the product sell itself when you aren't in the room.

## Potential Objections
* **Complexity:** "I'm not technical enough to run the demo." (Counter: Coast provides guardrails and pre-built templates so you can't break it).
* **Time:** "I don't have time to build demos." (Counter: AI-assisted templates take seconds to personalize; you aren't building from scratch).
