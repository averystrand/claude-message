# Persona D: Executive Buyer (CRO / VP Sales)

## Attributes
- **Job Titles:** Chief Revenue Officer, VP of Sales, Head of GTM
- **Role in the Buying Process:** Executive Buyer (Budget Holder)
- **Role in the Product:** Observer (Views reports/results)

## Roles & Responsibilities
Responsible for top-line revenue growth, sales efficiency (CAC/LTV), and team productivity.
* **Revenue Growth:** Hitting quarterly targets and forecasting accurately.
* **Sales Efficiency:** Reducing cycle times and increasing win rates.
* **Resource Allocation:** Ensuring expensive resources (like SEs and Engineers) are focused on high-value activities.

## Relevant Signals
* **Stalled Deals:** "Slipping" deals in the forecast due to "technical evaluation" delays or lack of buyer urgency.
* **High SE Costs:** Hiring more SEs linearly with revenue growth, which hurts margins.
* **Long Ramp Times:** New reps taking too long to become productive because the product is "hard to learn".

## Value Messages
**Collapse Time-to-Value**
Shorten sales cycles by 20-30% by removing the friction between "interest" and "proof," allowing your team to close more revenue per quarter.

**Scale Revenue, Not Headcount**
Get 10x leverage from your existing SE team by offloading routine demos to AEs and automation, avoiding the need to hire an army of engineers just to support sales.

**Turn Demos into Data**
Gain visibility into what is actually happening in sales calls with analytics that track prospect engagement, giving you better signals for forecasting and coaching.

## Potential Objections
* **Budget:** "We have tight budgets." (Counter: You are already paying a "hidden tax" in engineering hours and lost deal velocity; this nets positive ROI quickly).
* **Disruption:** "Implementing a new platform will slow us down." (Counter: Teams like Lean Tech implemented in <1 week and saw immediate SLA reductions).
