# Persona C: Product Manager / Product Marketing (PM/PMM)

## Attributes
- **Job Titles:** Product Manager, Director of Product Marketing, Head of Growth
- **Role in the Buying Process:** Influencer, Champion
- **Role in the Product:** Owner/Administrator (Defining the story)

## Roles & Responsibilities
Owns the product narrative, positioning, and go-to-market strategy; ensures the market understands the value.
* **Positioning:** Ensuring the sales team tells the "right" story consistent with the brand.
* **Launch Enablement:** Arming the field with assets to sell new features.
* **Demand Gen:** Creating content (website, campaigns) that drives qualified leads.

## Relevant Signals
* **Inconsistent Messaging:** AEs are "freestyling" demos or showing old features because they lack updated assets.
* **Launch Gaps:** Features are launching but sales teams aren't ready to demo them effectively.
* **Website Friction:** High bounce rates on marketing pages because visitors can't "see" the product without booking a meeting.

## Value Messages
**Consistency at Scale**
Create a "golden master" demo that ensures every seller, partner, and marketer tells the exact same product story, eliminating off-brand or inaccurate pitches.

**Product-Led Marketing**
Embed interactive sandboxes on your website to let the product do the talking, converting visitors into high-intent leads who already understand the value.

**Sell the Roadmap**
Build demos for features that are still in development (using mocks), allowing you to train sales and generate demand before the code is even finished.

## Potential Objections
* **Resource Drain:** "I don't have engineering time to build marketing assets." (Counter: You don't need them; PMMs can build in Coast without devs).
* **Brand Control:** "We can't have random demos floating around." (Counter: Enterprise governance allows you to lock templates so the field can't break the brand).
