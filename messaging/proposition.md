# Messaging House - Proposition

Our Proposition defines the unique value we deliver to customers and why it matters.

Use this section as the primary source of value messaging that should be reflected across all messaging and content assets. 

## Messaging Blocks

### Unique Value Propositions

[Instructions:
Document the core value propositions that anchor your messaging system. Each proposition should describe a differentiated outcome only your company can deliver, tied to a real, timely, and funded customer problem. These propositions should remain consistent across campaigns, assets, and channels.

Claude will use these as the baseline for all value-led messaging.]

[Tips:
– Focus on measurable business and technical outcomes, not features
– Each proposition should stand on its own as a key message
- Align propositions to your portfolio messaging for direct mapping]

[Format:
For each value proposition, include:
– One-Liner: A concise statement of the differentiated outcome
– Supporting Messages: 3 bullets that expand on the outcome and context
– Why It Matters: The buyer impact or risk addressed
– Why We're Different: What makes this uniquely yours
- (Optional) Portfolio Mapping: Are there specific products or solutions that this pillar applies to?]
