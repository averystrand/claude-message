# Messaging House - Preferences

## Technical Depth

[Instructions:
Define the default level of technical depth your messaging should assume. This establishes a baseline so content is neither over-explained nor under-explained.]

## Tone Style

[Instructions:
Describe the overall vibe and personality of the brand voice.]

## Theme Pillars

[Instructions:
List the core beliefs, principles, or statements you want echoed throughout messaging.]

## Tips & Tricks

[Instructions:
Provide practical writing guidance learned through experience. These are guardrails that improve clarity, quality, and taste.]

## Tropes to Avoid

[Instructions:
Explicitly list cliches, buzzwords, patterns, or styles you reject.]

## Rules

- Preferences are always-on unless explicitly overridden by a Skill
- Tropes to Avoid take precedence over all other stylistic guidance
- Do not introduce stylistic elements that conflict with defined Tone Style or Theme Pillars

## Guidelines

- When in doubt, favor clarity, precision, and restraint
- Consistency of voice and clarity in message matters more than creativity
- Let insight and structure carry the message, not stylistic flair
