## Technical Depth

Technical but Accessible (The "Smart Peer" Standard) Assume the reader is technically literate—likely an API-first founder, Solutions Engineer, or Product Marketer. Do not dumb down core concepts; use precise terminology like webhooks, endpoints, latency, idempotency, and auth headers correctly. However, always bridge technical features immediately to business value. We are selling to technical teams, so accuracy builds trust, but we are selling for business outcomes (revenue, velocity), so clarity is king

## Tone Style

Direct, Pragmatic, and Action-Oriented Our voice is confident and rooted in the reality of selling complex software. We don't use fluff; we speak in outcomes ("shaved 47 days off sales cycles" ). We are empathetic to the pain of "demo duty" and the frustration of "duct-tape demos". We sound like a partner who has been in the trenches of a high-stakes technical sale and knows exactly what it takes to win. We are "serious about shipping" but maintain a human, supportive connection ("breaking bread > breaking prod")

## Theme Pillars

1. Reality Beats Abstraction (Show, Don't Tell) Hypotheticals kill deals. We believe that buyers need to see the product work in their own context—with their own data—to trust it. We move away from "imagine if" and towards "let me show you".

2. Independence & Self-Sufficiency Sales and marketing teams should not be blocked by engineering queues. We champion a world where GTM teams have the autonomy to create and customize assets instantly, freeing developers to build the actual product.



3. Tangibility for the Invisible APIs are inherently hard to visualize. Our core mission is making backend logic tangible. We don't just show a UI; we show the "under-the-hood" magic that proves the technology is real.
## Tips & Tricks

Contrast "Then" vs. "Now": Frequently juxtapose the old way (static slides, Figma, "doc dumps") with the Coast way (interactive, personalized, live) to heighten the value proposition.



Validate with Specifics: When describing features, mention specific technical capabilities (e.g., "handle conditional logic," "simulate mock responses") to prove the platform's robustness.


Focus on the "Empathy Gap": Highlight the disconnect between a technical product's capability and a non-technical buyer's understanding. We exist to close that gap.


Use "You" phrasing: Speak directly to the pain of the specific persona (e.g., "Stop wrangling local environments" for SEs; "Demo without handoffs" for Sales).
## Tropes to Avoid

"Imagine..." – Never ask the audience to imagine a solution. We exist because imagination failed. Use "See," "Experience," or "Show."

"Smoke and Mirrors" – Do not imply we are faking the product. We are simulating or mocking smartly. Emphasize that the logic is real, even if the data is mocked.


"Click-through" or "Screenshot" – Avoid reducing Coast to a simple slide-show tool. It is a logic-aware platform. Use "Interactive Demo," "Simulation," or "Workflow" instead.


Generic "Transformation" Speak – Avoid vague claims about "digital transformation." Be specific: "shorten sales cycles," "qualify leads faster," "eliminate demo lag."

## Rules

- Preferences are always-on unless explicitly overridden by a Skill
- Tropes to Avoid take precedence over all other stylistic guidance
- Do not introduce stylistic elements that conflict with defined Tone Style or Theme Pillars

## Guidelines

- When in doubt, favor clarity, precision, and restraint
- Consistency of voice and clarity in message matters more than creativity
- Let insight and structure carry the message, not stylistic flair
