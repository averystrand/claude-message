# Messaging House - Pitch

Our pitch is our strategic company narrative — the story we tell end-to-end to explain why change is necessary and why we are uniquely positioned to lead it.

Use this section to bring an element of storytelling into messaging and content assets.

## Messaging Blocks

### Strategic Narrative

[Instructions:
Document the full strategic narrative in a structured format for both human and Claude understanding. This should cover the full arc from market conditions to inflection points to your undeniable advantage. The structure below is guidance to ensure completeness, not a script that must be followed rigidly.

Claude will use this to inject storytelling, structure long-form content, and maintain a consistent differentiated narrative across assets.]

[Tips:
– Your narrative is more about your audience than it is about you
- The stronger the inflection, the greater the urgency
- Even with structure, write in a conversational tone to give it a natural flow]

[Format:
Use the following narrative components as structural guidance:]

#### The Scenario
[Instructions:
Set the scene with an attention grabbing hook that describes the current conditions your target audience is facing that indicate change is afoot.]

#### The Inflection
[Instructions:
Define the industry-wide forces and movements that are forming (or about to form) that make it clear that it would be a risk to ignore what's happening.]

#### The Status Quo
[Instructions:
Explain why existing and alternative approaches are insufficient despite their grand attempts. It's important to call out attempts because it means people care enough, some have taken a swing and a miss, but you're setup to be different.]

#### Our Smart Insight
[Instructions:
Describe the one thing you figured out that others didn't, or got wrong when they tried. This isn't to gloat, it's to gain trust that you're on to something different.]

#### Our Unique Approach
[Instructions:
Describe what you built and why it's different - whether architecture, capabilities, delivery, or experience-driven. Be explicit as there's a lot of setup to get to this point.]

#### Our Proof of Value
[Instructions:
Share tangible proof points that support the setup and your advantage. This should be aimed at the big opportunity – it could be customer quotes, analyst mentions, or community love.]

#### Your Reason to Believe
[Instructions:
Give your audience something to advocate for, a realization that a perfect world is within grasp. It comes from recognizing the pain in the scenario and agreeing with the insight.]

#### Your Undeniable Gain
[Instructions:
Articulate the realized value in embracing change in the direction you've set. These should be quantiative and qualitative measures that speak directly to what your audience is on the hook for and investing in.]

#### Your Step to Action
[Instructions:
Close with tangible steps forward. This isn't a CTA on a website, this is your strategic narrative, so make it tied to embracing trends.]

### Elevator Pitch

[Instructions:
Provide a short, conversational version of the strategic narrative as you would deliver it in an elevator, at a booth, or early in a call. This is meant to quickly spark interest and strike a chord for a follow up.

Claude will use this as a quick-reference narrative when brevity is required or when transitioning into deeper discussion.]

[Tips:
– All bangers, no filler - keep it tight
- Assume no context like you're starting a new chat session
]

[Format:
2–4 sentences written in natural, spoken language]
