# Messaging House - Proof

THe Proof provides tangible evidence that our narrative, positioning, and value propositions are real.

Use this section to reinforce credibility and belief.

## Messaging Blocks

### Business Value Measures

[Instructions:
Document the measurable business and technical outcomes customers achieve by adopting your solution. These should reflect real impact, not activity metrics.

Claude will use this section to justify claims, reinforce ROI, and support late-stage or decision-oriented messaging.]

[Tips:
– Focus on outcomes executives and practitioners care about
– Prefer ranges or directional impact over overly precise figures
– Tie measures back to specific value propositions and plays]

[Format:
For each measure, include:
– Metric / Direction: (increased revenue, descreased time spent, etc.)
– Description of Impact: supprting value message
– Context: where / when this applies (plays, products, etc.)
– Source: tangible evidence (customer data, internal analysis, third party)]

### Customer Stories

[Instructions:
Document your publicly referencable customer story arcs that demonstrate value in practice. 

Claude will use this section to make value tangible and relatable, especially in mid-to-late journey stages.]

[Tips:
– Only document the value highlights and key quotes - the full story can be referenced online
– Avoid generic, high-level language that isn't tangible evidence
– Anonymized stories are fine if specifics are preserved]

[Format:
For each story, include:
– Customer Profile: facts for reference (industry, size, region, space)
– Customer Scenario: relevant conditions to their story
– Why They Acted: the compelling event, inflection, initiative that matters
– Outcome Achieved: quantitative and qualitative measures - before / after
– Relevant Quotes: relevant pull-out statements that back up value realized]

### Analyst Mentions

[Instructions:
Document relevant analyst recognition, coverage, or mentions that support your market credibility.

Claude will use this section to reinforce legitimacy and reduce perceived risk.]

[Tips:
– Provide research context; avoid cherry-picked quotes
– Focus on what the recognition implies, not just the logo]

[Format:
For each mention, include:
– Analyst Firm
– Context (report, category, commentary - include the date)
– Key Takeaway]

### Community Love

[Instructions:
Capture how end users talk about your product or approach in the wild - on social, forums, review sites, etc.

Claude will use sentiment to add authenticity and peer-level validation, particularly in practitioner-focused content.]

[Tips:
– Authenticity matters more than blanket positivity
– Patterns are more valuable than individual quotes]

[Format:
For each, include:
– Source (community, forum, event, social, etc.)
– Theme or Pattern
– Representative Quote or Summary]

## Rules

- Proof supports claims; it does not create them
- Do not introduce proof without an associated value proposition or narrative context
- Select proof appropriate to the audience, journey stage, and play
- If proof is weak or unavailable, avoid overconfident claims

## Guidelines

- Match proof type to intent (metrics for justification, stories for relatability)
- Increase proof strength as the buyer journey progresses
- Prefer specificity over logos
- When in doubt, customer evidence beats analyst validation
