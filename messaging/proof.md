## Rules

- Proof supports claims; it does not create them
- Do not introduce proof without an associated value proposition or narrative context
- Select proof appropriate to the audience, journey stage, and play
- If proof is weak or unavailable, avoid overconfident claims

## Guidelines

- Match proof type to intent (metrics for justification, stories for relatability)
- Increase proof strength as the buyer journey progresses
- Prefer specificity over logos
- When in doubt, customer evidence beats analyst validation
