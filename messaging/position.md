# Messaging House - Position

Our Position is our market space, and the competing alternatives we go up against. 

Use this section when performing market and competitive research. Also use this section to ensure messaging is relevant to industry trends and market directions, and that messaging is clearly differentiated amongst the rest.

## Messaging Blocks

### Market Landscape

[Instructions:
Provide an opinionated description of the market space you operate in. Focus on scenarios, trends, inflection points, and constraints shaping buyer behavior. This should explain why the market looks the way it does today and why change is necessary.

Claude will use this to establish relevance and urgency, especially in thought leadership, blog content, and top-of-funnel assets.]

[Tips:
– Anchor on market forces - technology shifts, operating models, regulatory changes, economic impacts, competitive moves, etc.
– Speak to industry trends - big movements, hype cycles, converging/consolidating/dying categories, etc.
– Introduce your unique perspective on the market today and where it's headed in your favor
]

[Format:
2-3 short paragraphs describing the market]

### Positioning Statement

[Instructions:
Document your relative position in the market by clearly stating who you're for and why you're different. This should reflect your unique perspective on the market, not just your offering.

Claude will use this as the baseline for differentiation across messaging.]

[Tips:
– Read April Dunford's book, Obviously Awesome
– Aim for your vision, but stay closer to reality
– Write to the common positioning framework for Claude's understanding]

[Format:
- For (Target Audience)
- Who (Statement of Need)
- And Want (Statement of Expectations)
- We are (Primary Position / Category)
- That (Statement of Key Benefit).
- Unlike (Alternatives)
- We (Primary Differentiation).
- Only Us (Unique Approach).
- With Us (Primary Gain)].

### Categories in Play

[Instructions:
Explicitly list the market categories you align with or intersect. For each category, define your current position and your strategic intent.

Claude will use this to perform market research and to understand where you fit relative to the larger market space. Also for keeping messaging relevant to specific categorical contexts when applicable]

[Tips:
– Be clear about direct and adjacent positioning
- It's okay for there to be a proverbial venn diagram - this is for context
– Be honest about your relative position - this isn't a pitch]

[Format:
For each category:
– Category Name and acronym
- Description: 1-2 sentence description of the category
- Solution: 1-2 sentence description of your solution
– Current position (1 sentence statement with relative position – Outside, New Entrant, Visionary, Challenger, Leader)
– Strategic aim (1 sentence statement with the end goal - Lead, Differentiate, Converge, Consume)
]

### Competing Alternatives

[Instructions:
List the alternatives customers evaluate instead of choosing you. This includes vendors, DIY, and inaction. Focus on patterns of choice, not just named competitors - this is scoped to messaging, not your competitive intelligence hub.

Claude will use this to sharpen contrast, frame trade-offs, and message with clear differentiation.]

[Tips:
– Group vendors by shared characteristics and behaviors - avoid calling out single vendors unless you must
– Focus messaging on what's uniquely yours
- Aim to keep this section fresh with the latest research]

[Format:
For each alternative or alternative group:
- Label (Common descriptor or specific vendor)
- Description:
– Type (Vendor, DIY, Inaction)
– Current Position (Emerging, Visionary, Challenger, Leader)
– Our Approach (Beat, Differentiate, Cooperate, Target, Monitor)]

## Usage Guidelines

- Use the Market Landscape to gain an understanding of the space
- Use the Positioning Statement to anchor relative positioning and to establish differentiation
