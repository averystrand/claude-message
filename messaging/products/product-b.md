## Product Overview
Coast Enterprise is the secure, scalable configuration of the Coast platform designed for large organizations, regulated industries (Fintech, Healthcare), and multi-product companies. It extends the core platform with advanced governance, security, and collaboration controls required to deploy interactive demos across global teams.

This edition focuses on "management at scale," allowing centers of excellence (like a central SE or Product Marketing team) to enforce brand consistency, manage user permissions granularly, and ensure that all demo assets comply with strict corporate security policies (SOC 2).

## Positioning Statement
Coast Enterprise provides the secure infrastructure and governance controls necessary for large organizations to unify their product storytelling across multiple teams and product lines.

## Critical Capabilities
* **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Seamless integration with enterprise identity providers (Okta, Azure AD, etc.) to manage user access and provisioning securely.
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Define granular permissions for who can build, edit, view, or share demos, ensuring that junior reps cannot break master templates.
* **Audit Logging:** Comprehensive activity logs that track changes to demos, user logins, and sharing activity for compliance and security reviews.
* **Isolated Workspaces:** Create distinct environments for different product lines, regions, or business units to keep assets organized and secure (multi-tenancy).
* **Private Cloud / On-Prem Options:** Flexible deployment options for highly regulated customers who need demos to run within their own private environment or VPC.

## Technical Details
* **Security Compliance:** SOC 2 Type II compliant, ensuring enterprise-grade data protection and operational security.
* **Scale Assurance:** Architected to handle high-volume traffic for public-facing website embeds and massive internal teams without performance degradation.

## Value Messages
**Govern the Narrative at Scale**
Ensure brand and technical accuracy across hundreds of sellers by locking down master templates and controlling exactly what can be customized.

**Secure by Design**
Meet the rigorous standards of bank-grade procurement teams with robust security features, allowing you to demo sensitive workflows without risk.

**Unify Disjointed Teams**
Break down silos between product units by providing a single, shared platform where different teams can collaborate on cross-product solution demos.
